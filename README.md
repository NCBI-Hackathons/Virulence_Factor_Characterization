# Virulence Factor Characterization in Metagenomes

###### Virulence Factor Characterization project from 2019 NIH Microbial Virulence in the Cloud Hackathon

# Approach
HMM trained against virulent and non-virulent gene datasets to predict contribution to virulence of genes?

Cluster contigs with MinHash to normalize over strongly-similar contigs

Our approach combines a
